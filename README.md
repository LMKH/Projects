# Logical Programming
***
Here I have created a programme which calculates and displays a users input against a table of awards. This scenaro is for a triathalon. Whatever time the user inputs, it will have a corresponding award. I have used arithmetic operations to calculate the totals. Simply input your hypothetical time in minutes and it will print out what award you would/would not have recieved.
