# Menu
***
This programme simply asks the user to input 3 food dishes of their choice. It will then print out neatly and clearly what they have chosen. This can be used for when you need a simple choice menu.

# Methods
***
.replace(), .upper(), .strip().
Here I show my knowledge of using different methods to change strings. The examples are: using .replace(), I can replace all instances of "!" with a empty space, using .upper to convert a lower case string to uppercase, and I use range and -1 to print the string in reverse. The following part shows how using the .strip() method can easily take all unwanted characters out of a string easily.

# Full Name
***
Programme that asks the user to input their name. If the name is too short for example an error message will be printed. Equally if the name is too long, larger than 25 characters another error message will be printed. Plus an error message if the user hasn't inputted anything. If everything is correct, it will print a welcome message. This code can be implimented for things such as online forms, site logins etc.

# Logical Programming
***
Here I have created a programme which calculates and displays a users input against a table of awards. This scenaro is for a triathalon. Whatever time the user inputs, it will have a corresponding award. I have used arithmetic operations to calculate the totals. Simply input your hypothetical time in minutes and it will print out what award you would/would not have recieved. This code can be changed and implimented for other uses. E.g. when you need to calculate amounts or times within certain criteria.

# Finance Calculator
***
I first import math. The programme asks the user if they would like to calculate for an Investment or a Bond. If they choose Investment the programme will asks for inputs such as the amount they would like to deposit, what the intrest rate is, and how many years they plan on investing. Following on from these inputs, user is asked for either a 'simple' or 'compound' input. For simple: The deposit multiplied by the intrest rate / 100 then multiplied by the number of years. For compound: Math.pow is used in this calculation. (X raised by the power of Y) The deposit multiplied, intrest rate / 100 * years again. For Bond it is the same sort of questions, but with a different calculation.

# While Loops
***
User inputs their number of choice, it will be stored and added up as the loop contiues to ask the user to input more numbers. Once the user is done adding numbers, they just have to input -1. This will exit the while loop and will calculate the average and the users number.
